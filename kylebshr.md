I'm Kyle Bashour, a junior computer science student at UT. I first started programming my freshman year at UT, but I've always loved computers. I make iPhone apps and want to focus on swoftware engineering. My website is [kylebashour.com](http://kylebashour.com). Swift is my favorite programming language.

Is CS445, I hope to learn how to work with big data and improve my python skills (which are essentially nonexistent right now).
